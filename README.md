## Hello! 👋, my name is Selene Flores and I'm:

  * Fullstack developer 👩‍💻💖 && Keen Learner 🤓 && Moon Lover 🌛

I'm a software engineer with 10+ years of experience in multiple languages and frameworks as `C#`, `Ruby`, `Elixir`, `Javascript (Vanilla)`, `SQL`, `Ruby on Rails`, `.NET framework`, `Angular`, `React`, etc. I describe myself as a goal and team oriented worker.

- 🌱 I’m always learning something new, at the current time I'm doing refactoring on a personal project with `NodeJS` and `Express` for my familiar business.
- Interested in start making contributions in data projects with `Python` (It's never enough for me)
