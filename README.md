I'm a software engineer with 8+ years of software development experience using multiple languages and tools as Ruby on Rails, React, NodeJS, .NET framework, Ruby, C#, Angular, Vanilla Javascript, etc. I describe myself as a goal and team oriented worker.

- 🔭 I’m currently working with React applications, using AWS amplify and CI.

- 🌱 I’m always learning something new, at the current time I'm also developing a personal project with NodeJS and Express for my familiar businness.

- 💬 Please feel free to ask me about everything you want, if I don't know about something I probably know someone who knows more than me😉. I'm always happy to know new people from all around the world 😃🌎

- [Women Who Code Colima Director](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/codificadas/) 💻, 
  I love communities and spaces for women to expand and share knowledge about programming and software engineering. ❤️👌
